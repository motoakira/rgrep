*** README ***

    rgrep.rb is a recursive grep, written in Ruby.
A recursive grep means that it grep-s recursively,
starting from the current directory, into sub-directories.

Current Version;
    Current version is V0.1.0.

USAGE:;
    rgrep.rb 'pattern' 'filename' ['filename' â€¦ ]
	
    Be careful to enclose pattern and each filename in single-quotes, 
so that shell won't glob them.

Apologies;
    Note that rgrep.rb digs in the Current Directory only.
    Neither rgrep.rb doesn't follow symbolic links.
	Pattern matching is done with Ruby's Regexp class.
